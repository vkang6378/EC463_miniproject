Frontend: 

The frontend of our Flask application is structured using a combination of Python code and HTML templates. The Python file forms.py contains two classes RegistrationForm and LoginForm, each defining fields with validators to ensure that the user input meets certain criteria. For the frontend display, HTML templates are used, which are located in the templates directory. When a user navigates to the registration or login page, Flask serves the corresponding HTML template, integrating the form fields as defined in forms.py. The main.css file contains the CSS rules that are applied to the HTML templates to ensure that the forms and other elements on the frontend are displayed properly and are visually appealing.
